# NCSU Library Busyness Frontend

This repository contains the React-based frontend for the NCSU Library Busyness tracker project.

## Technologies

This site uses Vite + TypeScript + React, with Tailwind CSS for styling and [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) for data visualization. It is deployed on GitHub pages, and that deployment is updated automatically on every commit via GitHub actions.

The backend is kept in a separate (private, for now) repository, and is based on AWS serverless infrastructure.
